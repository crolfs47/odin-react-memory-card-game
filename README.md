## The Odin Project - Memory Card

Project completed as part of The Odin Project. My first React application. Create a memory card game application. The player wins by clicking on all 12 cards only once. If a player clicks on the same card twice, the game will restart.

## Features:
 - New cat images are fetched from The Cat API for each game- https://thecatapi.com/
 - Cat images are shuffled after each move using the Fisher Yates shuffle algorithm
 - Scoreboard keeps track of the current score and the player's highest score
 - Score resets to zero and new game is started if the player clicks on the same card twice

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Javascript/HTML/CSS
 - React
 - Vite
 - ESLint
 - Netlify to deploy

## What I learned:
 - How to use the useEffect hook
 
## Still can improve:
 - Kept CSS styling simple, could improve
 - Could add memory storage so players don't lose their high score
